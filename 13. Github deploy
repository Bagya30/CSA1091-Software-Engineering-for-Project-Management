Implement Continuous Deployment using GitHub Actions to deploy a Dockerized application.
Tasks:
1.Set up a GitHub repository and push a simple Dockerized application.
2.Create a GitHub Actions workflow to automatically build and push the Docker image to Docker Hub or GitHub 
Container Registry.
3.Automate deployment to a cloud platform (e.g., AWS ECS, Azure Kubernetes Service, or Google Kubernetes 
Engine).
4.Test the CI/CD pipeline by pushing new code changes and verifying that the deployment occurs automatically
