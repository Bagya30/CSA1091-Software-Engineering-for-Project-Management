Demonstrate how to work with Git branches and resolve merge conflicts when collaborating with others.
Tasks:
1. Clone a shared repository to your local machine.
2. Create a new branch and switch to it.
3. Make changes to a file (e.g., update a README or modify code in a specific function).
4. Commit your changes.
5. Push the changes to the remote repository.
6. Before merging, pull the latest changes from the main branch.
7. Switch back to your feature branch.
8. Merge the main branch into your feature branch.
9. If there are conflicts, resolve them manually by editing the conflicting files. After resolving conflicts, mark 
the conflicts as resolved.
10. Commit the resolved merge.
11. Push your feature branch with the merged changes to GitHub and create a pull request.
12. Submit a summary of the steps you performed, the conflicts you encountered, and how you resolved them.
